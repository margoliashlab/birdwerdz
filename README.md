# birdwerdz

Birdwerdz is an automated birdsong recongnitzion tool based on an algorithm published by Fantana 
and Kozhevnikov (2014). 

### Requirements
Birdwerdz is a Python 2 package which requires the packages Cython, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and [arf](https://github.com/margoliashlab/arf). The package incorporates a Cython extension module which should work cross platforms but has only been tested on Linux.

### Installation
To install, clone this repository, cd into the repository folder, and enter this command as root:

    python setup.py install

### Overview
The algorithm uses DTW to find potential matches it a recording to a given template.  These 
matches represent local minima in the space of mappings between the template recording 
and the recording to be analyzed.  This set of matches contains all of the examples of the 
template vocalization, as well as many false positives.  In the second step of the algorithm a 
simple cluster analysis is performed on the potential matches in order to obtain the final 
results.
  
### Command-line interface

The command-line interface works with hdf5 files saved according to the [arf](https://github.com/margoliashlab/arf) standard. Your recordings should be saved as arf datasets. Make sure that the datatype attribute of these datasets is set to 1 (the code for audio data), so that the program knows which recordings in the file to analyze. The arf file should also contain a template recording, and a label dataset which labels events or intervals in the template. The end result after running through the birdwerdz procedure will be that the original arf file will have added to it 

To use the birdwerdz command-line interface, enter commands of the form "birdwerdz [command]." The available commands are "classify", 'cluster", "label", "plot", and "select." Entering "birdwerdz -h" will list these commands and their descriptions. Entering "birdwerdz [command] -h" will print the documentation for each command.
